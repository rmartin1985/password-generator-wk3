# Password Generator - Bootcamp Challenge week 3

This week I have created a password generator. These are becoming increasingly more necesssary in today's world as cyber security has become a larger issue. Being able to create a new password that is secure enough is hard to do off the top of ones head. This application was built in order to take that guess work away and create a random password for anyone to use. 

I was provided a starter code of HTML and CSS and was given the challenge of adding JavaScript to make this password generator more interactive and functional. 

## Usage

* Upon loading the page, the user will see a screen with a blank box and a button that says "Generate Password".
* The user will click the button and then be given a prompt for the number of characters that they would like have for their password.
* The password length for this application needs to be between 8 and 128 characters long. 
* Then the user is asked if they want to include lower case, upper case, numbers, and special characters in their password.
    * choosing OK will add the specific character type to their final password
    * choosing CANCEL will leave out that specific character type from their final password
* Once the user has clicked through all of the alerts, a randomly generated password will appear in the text box for them to use.
